# Rolands Terminal Portfolio Website

This project was made in an afternoon because I wanted to make a sweet looking portfolio based on the linux terminal.

git clone the repo <br/>
in your terminal run <br/>
npm install <br/>
wait till packages are installed, then <br/>
npm start <br/>

and you will see a working demo in your local browser.

Deployed on Digital Ocean. Built using React, HTML and CSS.
